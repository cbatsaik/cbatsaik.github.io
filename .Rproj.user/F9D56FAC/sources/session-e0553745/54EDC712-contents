## Introduction

In this project, my groupmates and I delve into the critical issue of the opioid epidemic, employing data analysis techniques and interactive visualizations to understand its impact and identify potential patterns.

## Objectives

-   **Data Exploration:** Dive into datasets related to opioid usage, overdose incidents, and associated factors.
-   **Trend Analysis:** Identify temporal trends and geographical patterns to better comprehend the evolution of the epidemic.
-   **Interactive Visualizations:** Utilize R and RShiny to create dynamic visualizations for enhanced data exploration.

## Methodology

I approach the analysis with a combination of statistical methods and data visualization tools. Leveraging the power of R and RShiny, I aim to provide an insightful perspective on the opioid epidemic.

## Expected Outcomes

Through this project, I anticipate shedding light on the opioid epidemic's dynamics, contributing valuable insights that may inform future interventions and policies.
